## Project Description

Build an app similar to Yelp that allows users to add, rate and comment on menu items at a restaurant. We discussed that so often the reviews on yelp are about the userâ€™s overall experience at the restaurant and you have to read a lot of reviews before you find suggestions for menu items they suggested. The concept is to highlight item reviews and would place highlight rated items at the forefront.
